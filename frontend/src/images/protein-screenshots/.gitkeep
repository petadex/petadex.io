# Protein Structure Screenshots

This directory contains static PNG screenshots of 3D protein structures.

## Quick Manual Method

For now, you can manually create screenshots:

1. Go to the detail page for a protein (e.g., `/sequence/WP_054022242.1`)
2. Wait for the 3D viewer to load the structure
3. Take a screenshot of just the 3D viewer canvas
4. Crop it to a square (400x400px recommended)
5. Save as `<accession>.png` in this directory

## Automated Method

Once Puppeteer is installed, run:
```bash
cd backend
npm run generate-screenshots:featured
```

## Required Screenshots for Carousel

- `WP_054022242.1.png` - IsPETase
- `WP_054022242.1_M1.png` - Fast-PETase

Any protein with a PDB structure can have a screenshot generated.
